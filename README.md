# Overview

If you clone or download this repositiry after installing the dependencies with **npm install** you can run **npm start** to get it running. If you have the expo go app downloaded on to your phone you can then open it up and scan the qr code in the terminal and the app will run on your phone.

It is a very simple app where you enter in some info about yourself and that info appears below. I wrote this app as a first step towards learning react native. I intend to expand upon this app and turn it into a full dating app one day with the assistance of my freind in business. All of the current content will be replaced with proper content that we discuss upon. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
